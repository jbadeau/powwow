This sample application provides a sample application that illustrates concepts
from the Managed Hub Overview chapter of the OpenAjax Hub 2.0 specification:

http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/OpenAjax_Hub_2.0_Specification_Managed_Hub_Overview

To run this application, you must set up your computer and Web server as follows:
(1) Set up you /etc/hosts file (or equivalent) and virtual hosts so that domains 
	http://mashup.foo.bar.com and http://c0.foo.bar.com are mapped to localhost
	(i.e., 127.0.0.1).
(2) Install the open source reference implementation at http://localhost/hub20 
	such that the samples/ directory can be reached as http://localhost/hub20/samples.
You can then run this sample as:
	http://mashup.foo.bar.com/hub20/samples/spec/ManagedHubOverview/manager.html

**** NOTE: WILL NOT WORK if you launch this sample as: ****
    http://localhost/....
