<h1>Sample Mashup Application Tutorial 2</h1>

<p>This tutorial assumes you have gone through the previous Tutorial 1.</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Bring up the <a href="http://www.openajax.org/2008_InteropFest/mashupapp">Sample Mashup Application</a>
		 and make sure that the canvas is cleared and make sure that the widget search box:</p>
		<p><img src="images/readme_search.png"/></p>
		<p>is clear. Then show the list of widgets by clicking on the magnifying glass icon: 
		<img src="images/readme_widgets.png"/>. Now we will filter the list to only show
		a subset of the available widgets. Type "dyn" into the widget search box and
		press the Return key on your keyboard. The list of widgets will
		show only the widgets whose names contain the letters "dyn",
		particularly, "Dynamic Data Generator" and 
		"Dynamic Data Viewer".</li>
	<li>First add a Dynamic Data Viewer widget to the canvas and move it
		to the right side of the canvas, then add a
		Dynamic Data Generator widget to the canvas.
		You will see the Dynamic Data Viewer widget display a continuously updated
		table of simulated stock prices. Now click on the 'Pause' button
		on the Dynamic Data Generator widget and notice how the 
		Dynamic Data Viewer stops because it no longer is receiving new data.
		Press 'Resume' and the updates continue. Now press 'Pause' once more
		to stop the event publishing.</li>
	<li><p>Now we are going to save this mashup onto the OpenAjax server. Click on the file menu:</p>
		<p><img src="images/readme_file.png"/></p>
		<p>and select 'Save As'. Into the dialog, enter a name for this mashup, such as 'dyndata1'. 
		and click 'OK'. Now choose the 'New' command from the file menu to clear your canvas
		and then choose 'Open' from the file menu and a small dialog will appear. 
		Click on the small down arrow to the right of the type-in box and you should see the
		name of your saved mashup. Select that name and click 'Open'.
		If you see the Dynamic Data Viewer widget continuously updating its display,
		press the 'Pause' key to stop the flow of events.</li>
	<li><p>The final step in this tutorial is to bring up the widget repository
		user interface. Click on the manage tool:</p>
		<p><img src="images/readme_manage.png"/></p>
		<p>and select the Manage Widgets command. This will open a separate
		window showing the widget repository user interface which will allow you
		to see metadata about the widgets that have been installed on the server,
		and if you have proper permissions, the ability to add or edit those widgets.
		Everyone can view the widgets. To view a particular widget, click
		on one of the widgets in the list and then click 'View' at the bottom
		of the repository window. For example, click on the Dynamic Data Viewer
		widget, then click 'View'. A dialog will appear with some descriptive
		information about the widget. Click on 'View Metadata File' and
		a browser window will open which shows the XML content for the
		OpenAjax Metadata file for that widget.</li>
</ol>
