<h1>How to Participate in the 2008 InteropFest</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
<em>The sample mashup application was the centerpiece for the OpenAjax Alliance interoperability event
back in 2008, the 2008 InteropFest. This page contains the old instructions that told various
classes of developers how they could participate in the 2008 InteropFest.</em>
</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>The following sections explain how different classes of developers can
participate in the 
<a href="http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/2008_InteropFest">2008 InteropFest</a>
and how they can work with the 
<a href="http://www.openajax.org/2008_InteropFest/mashupapp">Sample Mashup Application</a>.
Subsequent sections provide some additional information about the
<a href="http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/2008_InteropFest">2008 InteropFest</a>.
</p>

<h3>JavaScript library developers</h3>
<p>
JavaScript library developers (or other developers with access to
the JavaScript library's source code) are strongly encouraged to generate OpenAjax Metadata files that define the
JavaScript APIs and widgets that are included in their library and then use the Validator widget
within the <a href="http://www.openajax.org/2008_InteropFest/mashupapp">Sample Mashup Application</a>
to validate their OpenAjax Metadata files. To explain in more depth:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>OpenAjax Metadata for JavaScript APIs</em> - By providing OpenAjax Metadata for your library's
	JavaScript APIs, you will enable developers who use your library to take advantage of Ajax IDEs
	that offer intelligent code assist and context-sensitive help.</li>
	<li><em>OpenAjax Metadata for Widgets</em> - By providing OpenAjax Metadata for 
	your library's widgets, you will enable your developers to take advantage of visual Web application design
	(e.g., drag and drop onto a canvas) in selected Ajax IDEs. Additionally, you will have made your widgets
	"mashable" in that they will be ready for use within mashup editors such as the 
	<a href="http://www.openajax.org/2008_InteropFest/mashupapp">Sample Mashup Application</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.openajax.org/2008_InteropFest/mashupapp">Sample Mashup Application</a>
includes a "Validator" widget that allows you to upload your
OpenAjax Metadatata files (either in the form of a single XML file or a ZIP package) and
validate your XML file(s) against the OpenAjax Metadata language schema. Library widgets
that have corresponding OpenAjax Metadata files can also be uploaded to the
Sample Mashup Application's repository, which will cause the widget to appear in the
Sample Mashup Application's list of widgets, and therefore can be included within a mashup.
A JavaScript library can claim to be a successful participant in the 
<a href="http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/2008_InteropFest">2008 InteropFest</a>
by producing OpenAjax Metadata files for a subset of their feature where those file validate successfully against the language schema.
</p>

<h3>Web Widget developers</h3>

<p>
(For the purposes of this discussion, a 
"Web Widget", aka Gadget, is a standalone Web component that can be embedded into other applications.
One of the leading formats in the industry for Web Widgets today is Google Gadgets.)
</p>
<p>
Web Widget developers are strongly encouraged to create an OpenAjax Metadata file for their
Web Widget, then use the Validator widgets within the 
<a href="http://www.openajax.org/2008_InteropFest/mashupapp">Sample Mashup Application</a>
to validate their XML, and if possible upload the file to the repository so that it can
be included within user-created mashups. 
A Web Widget developer can claim to be a successful participant in the 
<a href="http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/2008_InteropFest">2008 InteropFest</a>
by producing an OpenAjax Metadata file for their widget where the file validates successfully against the language schema.
</p>

<h3>IDE developers</h3>
<p>
IDE developers should add support for both aspects of OpenAjax Metadata to their products:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>OpenAjax Metadata for JavaScript APIs</em> - This will allow your IDE
	to provide intelligent code assist and context-sensitive help for arbitrary
	JavaScript libraries.</li>
	<li><em>OpenAjax Metadata for Widgets</em> - This will allow your IDE to support
	rich visual editing with widgets from arbitrary Ajax libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>
An IDE can claim to be a successful participant in the 
<a href="http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/2008_InteropFest">2008 InteropFest</a>
by consuming OpenAjax Metadata files and demonstrating user interface features that
reflect the information from the OpenAjax Metadata files.
</p>

<h3>Mashup editor developers</h3>
<p>
Mashup editor developers should add support for OpenAjax Metadata for Widgets and
OpenAjax Hub 2.0 to their products. This will enable your mashup editor
to support the industry standard for Web Widgets and support the secure
mashup runtime framework provided by OpenAjax Hub 2.0.
</p>
<p>
A mashup editor can claim to be a successful participant in the 
<a href="http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/2008_InteropFest">2008 InteropFest</a>
by consuming OpenAjax Metadata files for widgets and/or including
support for OpenAjax Hub 2.0.
</p>
<p>
One way for mashup editor developers to study the secure mashup techniques
use by the 
<a href="http://www.openajax.org/2008_InteropFest/mashupapp">Sample Mashup Application</a>
is to run the 
<a href="http://www.openajax.org/2008_InteropFest/mashupapp">Sample Mashup Application</a>
within a tool such as Firebug and examine the use of IFRAMEs in different subdomains
to achieve widget isolation.
</p>

<h3>Users</h3>
<p>
Users who are interested in learning more about user-designed mashups
(i.e., where applications are assembled without programming), or are interested in learning more about "secure mashups",
can play with the mashup editor to add widgets to the canvas and link the widgets so that data can be passed
from one widget to another, all within the context of the security management features that are included
in the <a href="http://www.openajax.org/2008_InteropFest/mashupapp">Sample Mashup Application</a>
(due to OpenAjax Hub 2.0 being used under the hood). 
</p>
	
<h3>Other topics relevant to the 2008 InteropFest</h3>
<p>
While the <a href="http://www.openajax.org/2008_InteropFest/mashupapp">Sample Mashup Application</a>
is the centerpiece of the 
<a href="http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/2008_InteropFest">2008 InteropFest</a>,
there are other aspects to the 
<a href="http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/2008_InteropFest">2008 InteropFest</a>:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Mashup editor open source</strong> - While this 
	<a href="http://www.openajax.org/2008_InteropFest/mashupapp">Sample Mashup Application</a>
	has no intent to ever becoming a commercial-grade software product, 
	the underlying code is designed to provide major pieces of underlying technology
	by which commercial-grade applications can be built. In particular,
	the open source logic for utilizing 
	<a href="http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/OpenAjax_Hub_2.0_Specification">OpenAjax Hub 2.0</a>
	and for processing 
	<a href="http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/OpenAjax_Metadata_Specification">OpenAjax Metadata</a>
	are designed for reuse by the industry.</li>
	<li><strong>JavaScript API documentation conversion tools</strong> - The OpenAjax Alliance open source
	project includes tools that help convert inline documentation comments, particular JSDoc, into
	OpenAjax Metadata. These tools can help JavaScript library developers automate the process
	for creation OpenAjax Metadata files for their JavaScript APIs. In one common workflow,
	the library developers standardize on JSDoc for inline comments, and then run the open source tools
	to generate OpenAjax Metadata.</li>
	<li><strong>Google Gadgets support</strong> - The 
	<a href="http://www.openajax.org/2008_InteropFest/mashupapp">Sample Mashup Application</a> supports two
	widget formats: OpenAjax Metadata for Widgets and (via adapter logic) Google Gadgets.</li>
</ul>
