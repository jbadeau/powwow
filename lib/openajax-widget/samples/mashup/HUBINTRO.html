<h1>OpenAjax Hub 2.0 Overview</h1>

<h3>Relationship of OpenAjax Hub 1.0 and OpenAjax Hub 2.0</h3>

<p>OpenAjax Hub 2.0 represents an update to OpenAjax Hub 1.0 in order
to address the requirements of secure mashups:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenAjax Hub 1.0 defines a industry standard API for pub/sub messaging (i.e., publish/subscribe)
between JavaScript components that are used within the same browser frame.</li>
<li>OpenAjax Hub 2.0 extends Hub 1.0 to add secure mashups where HTML+JavaScript components
(i.e., widgets) can be isolated into secure sandboxes (using IFRAMEs typically)
and can communication each other via pub/sub messaging using OpenAjax Hub 2.0,
where Hub 2.0 allows messages to be passed securely across browser frames.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Working Together: OpenAjax Hub 2.0 and OpenAjax Metadata</h3>

<p>OpenAjax Hub 2.0 and OpenAjax Metadata were designed in coordination to ensure that
the Web Widgets defined using OpenAjax Metadata would have the required information
necessary to allow those widgets to be used conveniently within a secure mashup framework
that is built on top OpenAjax Hub 2.0.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>OpenAjax Hub 2.0</strong> - 
	<a href="http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/OpenAjax_Hub_2.0_Specification">OpenAjax Hub 2.0</a>
	specifies industry standard APIs for a secure mashup runtime 
	that runs in today's browsers (and that has a forward-looking architecture for future browsers). 
	In addition to the Hub 2.0 specification which defines standard APIs,
	OpenAjax Alliance is also producing a commercial-grade open source reference implementation
	of Hub 2.0.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAjax Metadata</strong> - In coordination with Hub 2.0, OpenAjax Alliance is defining
	<a href="http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/OpenAjax_Metadata_1.0_Specification">OpenAjax Metadata</a> for Widgets.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two initiatives help the industry realize the potential of 
mashup technologies to enable user-generated situational applications, 
where applications are assembled in the browser by end users by dragging various widgets 
onto a canvas and connecting widgets together. 
These initiatives address the two main inhibitors to widespread deployment of mashups:

<ul>
<li><strong>Mashup security</strong> - The main goal with user mashups is to allow users
to discover and use 3rd party widgets within a composite applications. Most 3rd party widgets
are trustworthy, but malicious widgets will exist and there are significant security
risks with mashups since widgets are assembled together within the same Web page.
A poorly designed mashup environment might allow malicious widgets to gain access to
user confidential or company confidential information, or leverage the user's 
credentials to extract and modify information in company databases. OpenAjax Hub 2.0
addresses these security issues by isolating widgets into "sandboxes" (usually using IFRAMEs) where widgets
can only communicate with each other over a managed message bus. Widgets can only receive and send
messages that are allowed by the security manager component.</li>
<li><strong>Widget interoperability</strong> - Today there are dozens of formats
for Web Widgets, including OpenSocial Gadgets, Apple Dashboard Widgets, 
Vista Gadgets, and Yahoo Confabulator widgets. 
<a href="http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/OpenAjax_Metadata_1.0_Specification">OpenAjax Metadata</a> for Widgets
defines an industry standard for Web Widgets for use in mashups.</li>
</ul>

<h3>A widget's view of OpenAjax Hub 2.0</h3>

<p>A Web Widget provides either a snippet of HTML that can be placed into an HTML DIV or a URL for a
web service that delivers a complete HTML page. In either case, the mashup framework manages the loading
and initialization of the widget, including the bootstrapping of the widget's ability
to publish and subscribe through Hub 2.0. The widget receives a <code>hubConnectionHandle</code>,
which is an opaque JavaScript object through which the widget can invoke:
<ul>
<li><code>hubConnectionHandle.publish(...)</code> - to broadcast a message that other widgets can receive</li>
<li><code>hubConnectionHandle.subscribe(...)</code> - to subscribe to messages that other widgets might send</li>
</ul>

<h3>A mashup framework's view of OpenAjax Hub 2.0</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.openajax.org/2008_InteropFest/mashupapp">Sample Mashup Application</a>
provides an open source reference implementation for how a mashup application can use
OpenAjax Hub 2.0 and OpenAjax Metadata to deliver a secure product for end-user-created mashups.</p>

<p>In the open source reference implementation, the mashup application loads the JavaScript source
code for OpenAjax Hub 2.0 and then creates a "Managed Hub Instance", attaching to that instance a
Security Manager. The reference implementation uses Hub 2.0 facilities for loading widgets
into secure sandboxes (usually using IFRAMEs) and uses Hub 2.0 for its low-level publish/subscribe
messaging system to allow widgets to communicate with each other.</p>
